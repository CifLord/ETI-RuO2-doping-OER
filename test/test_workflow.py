"""
We will test the workflow for generating single dopant and two dopant systems. We dope the first two layers of RuO2. By breaking the symmetry of RuO2 and turning it into a 2D structure, we now have two distinct Ru positions at each layer that can be doped: Ru w/ 4O and 2O CN on the same plane. When considering the first two layers, this means there are 4 distinct Ru positions available for substitution.
